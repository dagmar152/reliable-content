    <h1>Privacy Policy for testproject</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: September 28, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to testproject. This privacy policy explains how your personal information is handled within the app. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage and Access</h2>
    <p>
        All data you generate and use within the app is stored exclusively on your local device. This includes all financial data, categories, and any other information you enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I, the developer, have no access to your data.</strong> The app is designed so that your information never leaves your device. It is not uploaded to any server, and it is not shared with me or any third party.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Transaction Data (PSD2)</h2>
    <p>
        The app allows you to fetch your bank transactions for your convenience. This process is handled in a secure manner using the PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transactions are fetched via a certified external party that is authorized to access bank data under the PSD2 regulations. The connection to your bank is handled entirely by this certified provider. The app only receives the transaction data you consent to retrieve, and as with all other data, it is stored only on your local device.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is never shared with anyone. Since the data resides only on your device, you are in full control. The app does not have any functionality to automatically share your information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for the security of your device. Since all data is stored locally, the security of your information is tied to the security of your phone or tablet. We recommend using a strong device password or biometric security features.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy within the app. You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us.
